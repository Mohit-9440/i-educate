                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                    knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                    storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                    educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
                    settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                    considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.</p>

                    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                        knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                        orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
                        the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                        through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle

                        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">As per the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2012, 96.5% of all rural children between the ages of 6-14 were enrolled in school. This is the fourth annual survey to report enrolment above 96%. India has maintained an average enrolment ratio of 95% for students in this age group from year 2007 to 2014. As an outcome the number of students in the age group 6-14 who are not enrolled in school has come down to 2.8% in the academic year 2018 (ASER 2018).[19] Another report from 2013 stated that there were 229 million students enrolled in different accredited urban and rural schools of India, from Class I to XII, representing an increase of 2.3 million students over 2002 total enrolment, and a 19% increase in girl's enrolment. </p>
